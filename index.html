                        <h2>John Von Neumann</h2>
                        <div></div>
                        <p>In measure theory, the "problem of measure" for an <strong>n</strong>-dimensional Euclidean space <strong>Rn</strong> may be stated as: <i>"does there exist a positive, normalized, invariant, and additive set function on the class of all subsets of <strong>Rn</strong>?"</i> The work of Felix Hausdorff and Stefan Banach had implied that the problem of measure has a positive solution if <strong>n = 1</strong> or <strong>n = 2</strong> and a negative solution (because of the Banach–Tarski paradox) in all other cases.</p>

                        <p> Von Neumann's work argued that the "problem is essentially group-theoretic in character": the existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the properties of the transformation group of the given space. The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the negative solution for higher dimensions, comes from the fact that the Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two, and is not solvable for higher dimensions. <i>"Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the change of group that makes a difference, not the change of space."</i> </p>

                        <p> In a number of von Neumann's papers, the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results. In anticipation of his later study of dimension theory in algebras of operators, von Neumann used results on equivalence by finite decomposition, and reformulated the problem of measure in terms of functions. In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory, he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert's fifth problem in the case of compact groups. In 1938, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in analysis.</p>

                                We all love our famous Italian plumber icon of Nintendo, correct? Mario saves Princess Peach multiple times from Bowser and has a closely-identical brother named Luigi. He is from a rated E game series and all, but the truth will have you shiver that Nintendo could come up with ideas based on eerie horrific experiences that happened to a victim back the 1970s.
                                <p></p>

                                Lets start from the beginning. July 12th, 1974 in Cherkassy (Ukraine) a 23 year old white woman was looking for a job. Her name was Pavla Florence and she had blonde wavy hair, blue eyes, two freckles on her left cheek, and skinny. She often dated men just for their money, yet she had the body of a model. Pavla never intended on going to college after graduation because the only hobby she loved was painting. She lived with her friend after graduation, but then was forced to be kicked out to support herself (since all she did from age 18-23 was drink, smoke, socialize, and paint). Pavla traveled around Ukraine for a job, and when she arrived at Kharkiv she finally found a job. Her job involved painting for a company.
                                <p></p>

                            </div>
                            <div class="paragraph">
                                In October 4th, 1974 a 25 year old Italian migrant man named Mario Siro Lombardi worked with Pavla in the company. Mario developed feelings for Pavla as they worked on a project for an advertisement poster, but no one knew how Pavla felt. Pavla was a little flirty to most men she met so it is hard to tell if she liked Mario.
                                <p></p>

                                As they spent times together working, all they developed together was just friendship (since Mario had trouble dating woman). Pavla could have had interest for another man during the time. Pavla usually rode public transportation (bus, trains) before and after work because she did not make enough money to afford a car. She lived in an apartment fourteen minutes away from work.
                                <p></p>

                                Around February 8th, Pavla was waiting for the bus around 10PM (she attended a late night meeting) but then a normal-looking man convinced her that the bus schedule changed and guided her to his car. Stalking yet thankfully, Lombardi observed what was going on because he usually follows Pavla after work to see where she goes (in case he wants to coincidentally meet up with her and talk to her more).

                            “Sometimes people ask me what the difference is between sociology and anthropology. There are the surface ones, of course — sociology typically studies first-world societies, whereas anthropology has a rep for studying so-called “primitive” cultures. But the fundamental difference is a philosophical one: sociologists study society, while anthropologists study culture.
                            <p></p>
                            What’s the difference? Let’s do a case study. It’s easy to notice a subtle sort of sexism in American textbooks. For example, studies have found that in biology textbooks sperm are seen as competitive creatures while eggs are passive receptacles they aim to penetrate. But the actual science on the subject is much less clear: eggs seem to do a fair bit of selection themselves, etc.
                            <p></p>
                            I saw a paper by an anthropologist on this fact; their argument was that these textbooks were a result of the sexism of American culture, a culture which sees men as competing for access to women, and those notions are naturally transported onto our writing about conception. Sexist culture, sexist output.

                            A sociologist would dig a little deeper. They’d see who writes the textbooks, perhaps notice a disproportionate number of males. They’d look into why it was that males got these jobs, find the sexism inherent in the relevant institutions. They’d argue it was the structures of society that end up with sexist textbooks, not some magical force known as “American culture”.

                            As you might guess, I’m on the side of the sociologists. Blaming things on culture — as if it were a natural property of a group of people or a mystical life force with its own mind — seems too facile. It also seems wrong.
                            <p></p>
                            I’ve mostly been talking about the cultural anthropologists, but there are also a subset of racist anthropologists (sometimes called “anthropological science,” in accordance with Wall’s Law). These anthropologists tried to measure different properties of people, see if they could quantify the differences between the races and predict criminality from the shape of the head.

                            Cultural anthropologists disdain all that and prefer to endorse a very left-wing notion of cultural relativism. (One shouldn’t make judgments about other cultures!) But in doing so, they end up pushing the judgments off onto the peoples involved. Just like the racist anthropologists, they end up suggesting that the reason people over here believe act differently from the people over there is because they’re different people.
                            <p></p>
                            But if there’s one thing we’ve learned from psychology, it’s that — for the most part — people are people, wherever you go. As Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment showed, put normal people into the wrong situation and they turn into devious enforcement machines. And put the same people into a different society and they’ll change just as fast.
                            <p></p>
                            It isn’t culture — whatever that is — that causes these things; it’s institutions. Institutions create environments which force a course of action. And that’s why I’m a sociologist.”
